## Question 1 (Ro): 

The Collatz conjecture concerns what happens when we take any
	positive integer n and apply the following algorithm:

	n=
	
	{n / 2 , if n is even
	
	3 * n + 1 , if n is odd

	The conjecture states that when this algorithm is continually applied,
	all positive integers will eventually reach 1. For example, if n = 35, the
	sequence is
	35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

	Write a C program using the fork() system call that generates this
	sequence in the child process. The starting number will be provided
	from the command line. For example, if 8 is passed as a parameter on
	the command line, the child process will output 8, 4, 2, 1. Because the
	parent and child processes have their own copies of the data, it will be
	necessary for the child to output the sequence. Have the parent invoke
	the wait() call to wait for the child process to complete before exiting
	the program. Perform necessary error checking to ensure that a positive
	integer is passed on the command line.

## Question 3 (Jordan): 

	Write a multithreaded program that calculates various statistical values
	 for a list of numbers. This program will be passed a series of numbers on
	 the command line and will then create three separate worker threads.
	 One thread will determine the average of the numbers, the second
	 will determine the maximum value, and the third will determine the
	 minimum value. For example, suppose your program is passed the
	 integers: 


	 90 81 78 95 79 72 85


	 The program will report
	 The average value is 82
	 The minimum value is 72
	 The maximum value is 95


	 The variables representing the average, minimum, and maximum values
	 will be stored globally. The worker threads will set these values, and the
	 parent thread will output the values once the workers have exited. (We
	 could obviously expand this program by creating additional threads
	 that determine other statistical values, such as median and standard
	 deviation.) (You can use Java or C)
